# CA Certificate Container for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

--------

## A quick note:

This project provides you with an alpine image that keeps your ca-certificates up2date. It also allows you to add custom certificates to use in all of your docker containers, which is useful if you use a registry with a self-signed certificate.
